# Stocks Application

A side project I am working on that integrates the Quandl API to get real-time stock data for any stock in my database. I gather the data using JSON and place the data into Stock objects that I created.

This project makes use of object-oriented programming as well as APIs.

This is still a work in progress. I plan on creating graphs for 1-day, 5-day, 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, and 5 years options using the JFreeChart library.
